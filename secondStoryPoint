You watch cautiously..
You swear at it!
It sees you!
A piano falls on its head!
You try to bite its leg...
It cleans your bedroom!
It borrows your pyjamas!
You watch The Princess Bride together.
It takes you fishing.
You go roller skating together.
It wants to trade lunches.
It steals your lunch money.
It tries to back flip.
You try to act cool.
It seems uncertain.
It stumbles on a tree root.
The police arrive.
It cooks you dinner.
It says something in French.
It gestures wildly!
It seems to want you to follow it.
It offers you a carrot.
It's pants don't fit.
It looks hungry.
You clean your glasses.
It steals your car.
It roars!
It looks like your Grandad...
You brew some beer together.
It starts shaving in front of you.
It chops down a tree!
It doesn't seem to have seen you...
It wants to meet your parents.
It knocks over the shopping trolley.
It wants to spoon.
It can't find the auditorium.
It asks for directions.
Its car's broken down.
It says it left the stove on.
It takes a while to get moving.
It asks you stupid questions.
It tells you boring stories.
It mimicks you.
You ride a merry-go-round together.
It pees into the wind.
It won't close its mouth.
It bathes in the river.
It keeps talking about the weather.
It sings beautifully.
Its shirt is caught on the fence.
