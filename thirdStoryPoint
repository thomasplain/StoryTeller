It starts crying
It starts undressing
You feel weird about it...
You start crying
You forget your name!
You poop a little!
You drop your burger!
Your parents take you home!
Its parents make you go home...
It won't apologise...
It runs!
You're UNSPEAKABLY angry.
You laugh maniacally!
You weep uncontrollably.
No-one believes you!
Nobody cares...
You're never quite the same...
You feel nothing.
You try to ignore it.
Your girlfriend leaves you.
You peel an orange.
You decide to go home.
You mourn your childhood.
You wonder why.
You wonder, 'what if...?'
You give up.
You avert your eyes.
Your mother hates you.
Your therapist won't let it go.
Why?
And so it began...
But that wasn't the half of it.
You give it a fake number.
You lose your cool.
It pushes you over the edge!
That's the last straw!
You miss your old school.
You wonder where your friends are.
You feel nostalgic.
You take it from there...
It's super effective!
What were you thinking?
No more cheese before bed.
Neither of you protests.
Your wallet's gone!
You realise you're naked.
Good luck getting the stain out.
You have the best sleep ever.
Guess you're out of options.
You wish you were smarter.
It's GO TIME!
